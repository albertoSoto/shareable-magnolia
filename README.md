# Shareable (Demonstrates sharing light modules)- Component template for Magnolia CMS #

A basic description in one sentence.

## Features ##
The control can render as an unordered list or as a select box.
How it renders can be configured by developers via parameters in the definition, and by authors in the dialog.

## Usage ##
Use this component as is, or simply as a starting point or inspiration for how to accomplish this common task.

* Make the component template available in your page.
* Add the component to your page.
* For decent styling of the list, optionally include the webresources/css/language-switcher-component.css on your pages.

### Demo ###
To see an example page demonstrating this component, open the Pages app in Magnolia AdminCentral and import the file in 'dev/importsSamples'. (Import it directly at the root of the tree to see a demo of the included css styling.)

## Contribute to the Magnolia component ecosystem
It's easy to create components for Magnolia and share them on github and npm. I invite you to do so and join the community. Let's stop wasting time by developing the same thing again and again, rather let's help each other out by sharing our work and create a rich library of components.

Just add magnolia-light-module and magnolia-component as keywords to the package.json to make them easy to find and use.
